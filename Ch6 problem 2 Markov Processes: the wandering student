%This is solution code for problem 2 in chapter 6 of Hahn and Valentine's MATLAB Essentials (5th edition)

%Create a nxn matrix of 0's
n = 6;
P = zeros(n);

%Iterate through matrix P and add probabilities that student is at that location (2/3 towards cafe, 1/3 towards home)
for i = 3:6
    P(i,i-1) = 2/3;
    P(i-2, i-1) = 1/3;
end

%Probability at beginning and end is 1 becasue the wandering student has to be in one of these states
P(1,1) = 1;
P(6,6) = 1;

%This Array describes where the student starts. If you move the starting location (1) to the right, you are starting the student closer
%to the cafe, and you will notice that the probability that our student ends up at the cafe will increase
x = [0 1 0 0 0 0]';

%This for loop iterates through the matrix and calculates the actual probability, so that the last row displayed is the final
%probability after t = 50 that the student will be at one location or another. 
for t = 1:50;
    x = P*x;
    disp([t x'])
end

%with x = [0 1 0 0 0 0]', you should find that the student has a ~48percent chance of ending up at home 
%and a ~51percent chance of ending up at the cafe
