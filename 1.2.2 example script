%Let's consider the following arbitrarily selected matrix:
A = magic(3)
%Let us evaluate it inversely as follows:
AI = inv(A)
%Check that it is indeed an inverse:
IPredicted = A*AI
%This is the exact unitary matrix:
IM = eye(3)
%This is the difference between the exact and predicated unitary matrix:
diff = IPredicted - IM
for m = 1:3
    for n = 1:3
        if diff (m,n) < eps;
            IPredicted(m,n) = IM(m,n)
        end
    end
end
IPredicted
IPredicted == IM
