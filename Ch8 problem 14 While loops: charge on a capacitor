%NOTE: this is what I have so far. The code is not working and I am still trouble shooting...

%This is solution code for probelm 8.14 in MATLAB Essentails by Hahn and
%Valentine (fifith edition). Ch8 is about practicing while loops

%Parameters:

V = 9;
R = 4;
C = 1;
Q = 0;
t = 0:.1:10;

%Create loop based on conditions/statements:


while Q <= 8
    disp('smaller...')
    Q = C*V*(1-exp(-t./R*C));
    disp(Q)
%    disp('t')
%    if Q < 8.2
%        disp('Bigger!!')
%    end
end


disp('done!'), disp (Q)
