%This is code for problem 1 soltuions in chapter 5 of MATLAB Essentials by Hahn and Valentine 
% Important: In MATLAB, 1 = True, while 0 = False

%Part a) What does MATLAB return when you enter:
1 & -1
%This returns 1 (True) because neither 1 nor -1 is a 0

%Part b) What does MATLAB return when you enter:
13 & ~ (-6)
%This returns 0 (False) becuase the ~ symbole reverses the binary informaton in (-6)
        13 & ~ 0 %returns 1 becuase ~ and 0 cancel eachother(?)
        ~13 & (-6) %returns 0
        ~13 & ~(-6) %returns 0

%Part c) What does MATLAB return when you enter:
0 < -2|0
%This returns 0 (False). 0 is not less than -2, so this statement is false. since 0 is also not less than 0, the entire statement is false. 
%Had there been a postitive integer, the whole statement would have returned true (since it's 'or', it only takes one option to be true for a return statement of 1

%Part d) What does MATLAB return when you enter:
~[1 0 2] * 3 
%This statement returns 0 3 0 becuase the '~' symbole does the opposite of the original statement (still not sure why the opposite of 0*3 is 0 though...
        [1 0 2] *3 %returns 3 0 6

%Part e) What does MATLAB return when you enter:
0 <= 0.2 <= 0.4
%This statement returns false becasue 0 <= 0.2 returns a 1, and 1 is not <= 0.4

%Part f) What does MATLAB return when you enter:
5>4>3
% This returns false because while 5>4, this returns a 1, and 1 is not less than 3

%Part g) What does MATLAB return when you enter:
2>3&1
%2>3 is false, and this returns a 0. The statement 0&1 then, is also false (it's a zero and a nonzero, which returns a false)
